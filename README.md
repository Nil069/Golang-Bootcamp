This repository is created for the Golang Bootcamp.
It focuses on learning the Go programming language and exploring backend development with Go.

Day 1:

Wrote the first Go program: printing "Hello, World!"

Learned about Go keywords.

Go has 25 reserved keywords that are fundamental to the languageâ€™s syntax. These cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names).

Go Keywords:
break, case, chan, const, continue, default, defer, else, fallthrough, for, func, go, goto, if, import, interface, map, package, range, return, select, struct, switch, type, var

These keywords play a vital role in defining control flow, data structures, and the behavior of programs in Go.
